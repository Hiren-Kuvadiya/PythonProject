# Student Class Test Cases

This repository contains Python classes for representing students and test cases to ensure the correctness of the `Student` class.

## Overview

The `Student` class represents a student with attributes such as name, class, age, and place. The class is defined in the `student.py` file. Test cases to verify the functionality of the `Student` class are written in the `test_student.py` file using the `unittest` framework.

## Files

- `student.py`: Contains the implementation of the `Student` class.
- `main.py`: creates an instance of 'Student' class.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the repository.

## Usage

To use the `Student` class, simply import it into your Python script as follows:

```python
from student import Student

# Create a student object
student1 = Student("John Doe", "12th", 18, "New York")
